# Near-Field-Propagation-Simulator
"X" is an open-source 2D simulator for modeling the electromagnetic wave near field propagation of large transmitter antennas (especially in THz and sub-THz frequencies) in the presence of arbitrary blockages and reflectors in the environment. Terahertz (THz) communications are envisioned to be a key technology in 6G and beyond wireless systems, enabling the demanding high data rates (100 Gbs) and large bandwidths. The large array aperture and high carrier frequencies in the THz band result in a large Rayleigh distance (over 10 meters), which positions most communication applications in the near-field region of the transmitter (Tx) antennas, where the traditional plane-wave assumption is no longer valid. Moreover, the severe propagation loss and blockage issues inherent in the THz band present significant challenges, hindering the system's ability to utilize the available bandwidth effectively. One of the fundamental tools to alleviate these problems and facilitate network optimization and planning is coverage mapping through received power prediction in different locations. However, traditional models developed based on far-field assumptions would fail to capture the near-field characteristics accurately, and running computationally intensive EM simulations on the base stations is not feasible, making effective power prediction extremely challenging for these systems. In this simulator, we provide accurate and efficient modeling of near-field propagation of TX antennas configured with arbitrary phase configurations and locations in interactions with arbitrary numbers of reflectors/blockages with different environmental properties. In this simulator, we provide options to generate interesting and special wavefronts introduced in the near field like Airy beam, Bessel beam, etc., or input user-defined phase configurations for TX antenna elements. Furthermore, "X" supports Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and rough scattering to model the near-field propagation. Ultimately, one can define the multiple RX properties as in a multiple UEs scenario to get the calculated power at each RX location on top of the coverage map. We have developed this simulator based on the physical principles of Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Integral Theory and Angular Spectrum Method and evaluate its performance by comparing the results generated from this simulator with a comprehensive EM simulator namely "Feko". The main purpose of this simulator is to provide a user-friendly interface to study the near field propagation model of large TX antenna arrays which are envisioned to be the key technology in the next generations of communication systems and more importantly provide an infrastructure to generate a significant amount of data for AI-enabled solutions. 

## Starting up the Graphic User Interface
In order to work directly with the GUI, you need to pull this repository and open up the 	**main_app.mlapp** in **appdesigner** in MATLAB. appdesigner environment can be opened by running the `appdesigner` in the MATLAB command line. The main app can be set up by easily just running the program.

## Setting Up Environmental Properties
In the first part of the program, one can create the environment of interest by choosing the resolution and dimension and adding as many blockages/reflectors with arbitrary properties to the environment.

## Adding Reflector/Blockgae
In order to add a reflector/blockage, one can click on the **Add New Reflector/Blocker** which would pop up a new window. In the new window, the user can define the location and orientation of the object (within the defined dimensions) along with the length and thickness of the object in the environment. **Power Ratio** determines the amount of power being reflected back with respect to the incident E field power. The power ratio of 1 represents perfect reflection, while the power ratio of 0 represents complete blockage (absorber). Furthermore, there are options to consider diffuse scattering by adding roughness parameters and also to place Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces as the reflectors by adding a text file that contains the designed phase shifts on the elements of the RIS. By determining the statistical properties of a rough surface $h_rms$ and $L_c$, the code would generate a random surface perturbation and it would be translated to the phase shifts introduced by rough scattering.
